# Tennis Court Line Detection by Using Image Processing Algorithms 

This project is the final project of the introdcution to image processing course. In the project, it is aimed to determine the lines of the tennis court while playing tennis tournaments. Thus, the game rules of tennis can be implemented algorithmically and the game will be completed by making error-free decisions by the referee.
 
# Usage of the code

- Download the zip file into any directory. 
- Unzip the file.
- open the directory in command prompt (cmd).
- write "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install required libraries.
- write "python main.py" to detect the lines of the images. It will detect the court lines and save to the "detected_lines" folder.
- To evaluate the results of the algorithm, write "python evaluate.py" into command prompt.
