# Tennis Court Line Detection by Using Image Processing Algorithms 

This project is the final project of the image processing fundamentals course. In the project, it is aimed to determine the lines of the tennis court while playing tennis tournaments. Thus, the game rules of tennis can be implemented algorithmically and the game will be completed by making error-free decisions by the referee.
